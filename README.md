# IR-Remote
## Introduction
This is a project for the course "microelectrical systems and design" in the electrical engineering and computer science studies at the Aschaffenburg University of Applied Sciences. The project will contain schematics and assembly code to build a custom infrared remote with the standard RC5 protocol.

## Schematics
- v1: basic schematic to show inputs and outputs with pic18f452
- v2: proper schematic including reset circuit, quartz oscillator and power supply
- v3: proper layout with remote design
